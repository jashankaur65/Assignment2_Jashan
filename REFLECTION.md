## Reflection
For this assignment, I built my personal resume as a webpage using HTML. The goal was to understand web design principles, semantic HTML, and accessibility.

# Structure:
My code is simple but well-structured. I used <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize the page. Each section has clear content like About Me, Skills, and Experience. I also added links, an image with alt text, and an SVG graphic. This made the page more professional and accessible.

# Start 
My coding process started with setting up the project folder and initializing Git. I made commits after every task, like adding structure, filling sections, and checking accessibility. This helped me track progress step by step.

# Challenge
The main challenge was making sure I used proper semantic elements and followed accessibility rules. At first, I was not sure about alt text and ARIA roles, but after reviewing, I understood how they improve accessibility. Another small challenge was validating my HTML, but fixing the errors helped me write cleaner code.

If I did this again, I would plan my sections better before starting. I would also add more content, like a small portfolio or references, to make my resume stronger.

Overall, this assignment taught me the importance of semantic HTML, accessibility, and version control. It connects to my course because these are the basics of application delivery and development. Before styling or adding advanced features, having a solid and accessible structure is the foundation.
